<!-- This is a rudementary system, but 
you can draw a path on Google earth, save it as a KMZ, convert that to a KML with an online tool,
 and copy the coordinates into an auto script like this. You can also use google maps and export a KML route.
 The idea is that this gives you the ability to set parameters and do other actions in paths -->
